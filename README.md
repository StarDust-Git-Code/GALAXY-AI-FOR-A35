A collection of Magisk modules and system tweaks to enable, port, and enhance AI-related features on the Samsung Galaxy A35 5G (SM-A356E).

---

## üöÄ Features

This project aims to bring a suite of AI-powered enhancements and hidden features to the Galaxy A35.

- [‚úî] **UI Enhancements:** Enable system-wide blur effects and other visual tweaks.
 - > **Drawback:** Enabling live blur is GPU-intensive. You may notice a slight increase in device temperature and occasional lag in home screen animations. For this reason, the live blur has been intentionally limited to core system UI (like the widgets Blur) to avoid severe performance issues.
- [‚úî] **Generative AI Features:** Port or enable features like AI Wallpaper, Photo Remaster enhancements, and more.
- [‚úî] **Performance Tweaks:** Optimize system properties for better performance on-device.

## üêõ Known Bugs

Please be aware of the following issues currently under investigation. If you can provide logs (`logcat`) for these crashes, please open an issue!

- **Generative Move Crash:** Using the "Generative Move" feature in the photo editor to reposition objects may cause the Gallery app to force close.
- **AI Cartoonizer Effect Crash:** Applying the AI-based "Cartoon" or "Toonify" effect from the Gallery labs or editor can result in a crash.
- **General On-Device Processing Crash:** Some intensive, on-device AI tasks (like complex object removal or video effects) may crash intermittently. This is likely due to missing libraries.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap (Future Scope)

Here are some of the features and improvements planned for the future:

- [ ] **Porting Flagship Features:** Investigate porting more advanced AI features from the Galaxy S series, such as battery health ML or Live Translate, if feasible.
- [ ] **AIO Module:** Develop an "All-in-One" Magisk module that combines the most popular tweaks into a single, easy-to-install package.
- [ ] **Performance Profiles:** Create modules to enable different system performance profiles (e.g., "Battery Saver AI," "Max Performance AI").
- [ ] **Deeper Camera Integration:** Explore modifications to the camera HAL or app to unlock hidden modes or improve image processing.
- [ ] **Script-based Installer:** Develop a script that allows users to pick and choose which features they want to install.
